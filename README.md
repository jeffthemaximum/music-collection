# Music collection

### configuration
- Run using node 8.9.4
    - Really anything above 7.6 should work, however, this has only been tested with 8.9.4
    - This is because the program uses async/await, and node versions < 7.6 don't support async/await

### before running
- In the root of the repo, run
    - `npm install`


### run tests
`npm test`

### run the program
`npm start`
